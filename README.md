# PersonalProjects

A few scripts I wrote to help improve my life

## productivity.py 
- track productive activities, with a point value for each activity (to be for giving rewards for certain point levels)
- suggest an activity to do next based on past activities

## workout.py
- very simple tracker of the exercises completed and a log of them 

## motivation.py
- gives you a quote based on your input of a topic/feeling or random

## koreanshows.py
- search popular korean media streaming site viki.com for new shows, shows by actors, alerts

## banking.py
- calculate by category your spending and see the places you visited (and spent on) the most
- I used a csv file I downloaded from my bank to generate the results (yeardata.csv)
