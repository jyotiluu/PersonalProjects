# PersonalProjects
A few scripts I wrote to help improve my life

productivity.py 
- track productive activities, with a point value for each activity (to be for giving rewards for certain point levels)
- suggest an activity to do next based on past activities

workout.py
- very simple tracker of the exercises completed and a log of them 

motivation.py
- gives you a quote based on your input of a topic/feeling or random
